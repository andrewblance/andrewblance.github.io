      <description>Bookclub Week 5 The past weeks we have been learning a lot of theory but, like Pheobe teaching Joey how to play the guitar, we have not put it into practice. This week we will see how to write code, assemble it, and make it run on an emulator.
This is a multi-stage process. First, we will have to find a way to run any assembled code. The code we write here is for a 6502, not a modern processor, and therefore will not natively run on our machines.</description>

      <description>Bookclub Week 4 Finally, after 3 weeks of Bookclub, we will start to actually write code. As we will see, we might not be able to copy-paste it into an assembler yet and make it run. After today though we&#39;ll be 90% of the way there. We will go over two examples: an easy one and a less-easy one. Looking at these will expand our knowledge of the instruction set of a 6502 and give us a better understanding of what kind of instructions are available.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to 6502 Assembly!</title>

      <description>Bookclub Week 1 For this session of my office&amp;rsquo;s book club I&amp;rsquo;m going to be looking at the 6502 assembly programming language. Each week I&amp;rsquo;ll try explain a little more about assembly and how to write it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the structure will change from week to week, or how I will split up the topics but I like the idea of using my webpage to host the content.</description>
