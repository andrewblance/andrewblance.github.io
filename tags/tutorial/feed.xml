      <description>Bookclub Week 4 Finally, after 3 weeks of Bookclub, we will start to actually write code. As we will see, we might not be able to copy-paste it into an assembler yet and make it run. After today though we&#39;ll be 90% of the way there. We will go over two examples: an easy one and a less-easy one. Looking at these will expand our knowledge of the instruction set of a 6502 and give us a better understanding of what kind of instructions are available.</description>

      <description>Bookclub Week 3 Assembly language is strongly linked to the architecture it is written on. Everything you write will, on some level, depend on the instruction set and hardware of the processor. To write a program you won&amp;rsquo;t require a deep knowledge of how the 6502 works, but to write an efficient one you will. We have begun to see this already. In week one we saw how instructions can be different on different machines and in week 2 we saw how the hardware enables us to compute things more easily.</description>

      <description>Bookclub Week 2 In week 1 we got to see a very brief look at how assembly, and specifically the 6502 variant, works. We built up an idea of what assembly is from the most basic binary patterns that a processor will want to accept. We then touched on the idea that a computer program will be made up of three parts: these instructions, data and memory locations. To get a good idea of how to effectively program the 6502 we will need to get a better understanding of all them.</description>

      <description>Bookclub Week 1 For this session of my office&amp;rsquo;s book club I&amp;rsquo;m going to be looking at the 6502 assembly programming language. Each week I&amp;rsquo;ll try explain a little more about assembly and how to write it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the structure will change from week to week, or how I will split up the topics but I like the idea of using my webpage to host the content.</description>
