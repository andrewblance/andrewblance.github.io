      <description>Bookclub Week 2 In week 1 we got to see a very brief look at how assembly, and specifically the 6502 variant, works. We built up an idea of what assembly is from the most basic binary patterns that a processor will want to accept. We then touched on the idea that a computer program will be made up of three parts: these instructions, data and memory locations. To get a good idea of how to effectively program the 6502 we will need to get a better understanding of all them.</description>
