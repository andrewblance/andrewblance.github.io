      <description>Bookclub Week 2 In week 1 we got to see a very brief look at how assembly, and specifically the 6502 variant, works. We built up an idea of what assembly is from the most basic binary patterns that a processor will want to accept. We then touched on the idea that a computer program will be made up of three parts: these instructions, data and memory locations. To get a good idea of how to effectively program the 6502 we will need to get a better understanding of all them.</description>

      <description>Bookclub Week 1 For this session of my office&amp;rsquo;s book club I&amp;rsquo;m going to be looking at the 6502 assembly programming language. Each week I&amp;rsquo;ll try explain a little more about assembly and how to write it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the structure will change from week to week, or how I will split up the topics but I like the idea of using my webpage to host the content.</description>
