      <description>Balthazar III Me and my flatmate have formed a terrible band who have just released an EP. It consists of 5 covers of famous songs! You can listen here!
In it I play the guitar, fiddle and a keyboard. My flatmate plays the bass and theremin. We both sing and try to program drums.
The EP&amp;rsquo;s tracks are presented in the reverse order in which we recorded them - meaning we recorded track 5 first.</description>
