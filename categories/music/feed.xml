      <description>What a long strange pip its been&amp;hellip; Grateful Dead have performed around 2500 shows. Remarkably, around 2200 of these have been recorded. To explore (most of) this data I have created a python package called jerryPycia. I think thats a really funny name. I&amp;rsquo;m also pretty happy with my &amp;ldquo;long strange pip&amp;rdquo; joke. You can install it using pip, like:
pip install jerryPycia  Its also available on my Github page.</description>

      <description>Balthazar III Me and my flatmate have formed a terrible band who have just released an EP. It consists of 5 covers of famous songs! You can listen here!
In it I play the guitar, fiddle and a keyboard. My flatmate plays the bass and theremin. We both sing and try to program drums.
The EP&amp;rsquo;s tracks are presented in the reverse order in which we recorded them - meaning we recorded track 5 first.</description>
